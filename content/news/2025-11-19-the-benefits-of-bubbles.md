The article discusses the current AI boom as a "bubble," comparing it to past technological bubbles like the dot-com era. It argues that while bubbles eventually pop, they can have significant long-term benefits by driving massive investment in infrastructure and fostering innovation.

Drawing on Carlota Perez's work, the author explains that speculative manias lead to an "Installation Phase" where necessary, often financially unwise, investments lay groundwork for future "Deployment Periods." The dot-com bubble, for instance, led to extensive fiber optic networks, which became the backbone of today's internet.

The article also introduces "Inflection Bubbles" from Byrne Hobart and Tobias Huber's book, which are characterized by investors believing the future will be fundamentally different. These bubbles act as coordinating mechanisms, accelerating progress across various domains simultaneously.

For the current AI bubble, the author highlights two key areas of beneficial long-term investment: semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs) and power generation. While GPU investments are short-lived, fabs and power infrastructure are long-term assets that could transform future capabilities. The article concludes that the AI bubble, despite its eventual pop, could yield lasting infrastructure and innovation, making it a worthwhile, albeit risky, endeavor.
