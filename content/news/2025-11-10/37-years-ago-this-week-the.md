In 1988, Cornell graduate student Robert Tappan Morris created the Morris worm, an autonomous program designed to measure the internet's size. It infected 10% of the internet within 24 hours, causing significant slowdowns, system crashes, and costly damage. The worm exploited vulnerabilities in email and "finger" programs on BSD UNIX systems. Morris released it anonymously from MIT to avoid detection. He was later identified, indicted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and sentenced to a fine, probation, and community service. The incident highlighted the internet's vulnerabilities and led to increased security awareness.
