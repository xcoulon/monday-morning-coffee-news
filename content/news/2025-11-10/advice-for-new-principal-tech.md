This article outlines 31 pieces of advice for new Principal Engineers or Scientists, drawing from observations and role models, primarily within an Amazon context. Key themes include:

*   **Shifting Focus:** Moving from individual coding to technical vision, design feedback, and broader influence.
*   **Broad Responsibilities:** Acting as a "part-time everything" across product, design, engineering, and more.
*   **Communication & Influence:** Emphasizing alignment, collaboration, and convincing others to act.
*   **Strategic Impact:** Identifying work that wouldn't happen without them, connecting dots, and scaling through others.
*   **Personal Management:** Guarding time, continuous learning, and defining a clear charter.
