Software supply chain attacks are increasing, with recent incidents like malicious debug and chalk packages and the Shai Hulud npm worm. AppOmni developed "Heisenberg," an open-source toolkit and GitHub Action, to address these threats. Heisenberg treats Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) as dynamic data to detect and block risky dependency changes in pull requests. It flags new, unhealthy, or advisory-linked packages and quickly identifies affected repositories during incidents. This automated approach aims to improve security without hindering development velocity.
