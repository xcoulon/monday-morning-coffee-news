Valve has introduced three new products: the Steam Controller, Steam Machine, and Steam Frame, aiming to dominate the next console generation. The Steam Controller is a straightforward input device. The new Steam Machine, with specs comparable to a PS5 and running an open SteamOS, is predicted to be a strong contender in the console market. The Steam Frame is a standalone VR headset that also functions as a Steam Deck, featuring a 64-bit ARM CPU and foveated rendering for optimized performance. The author believes the only potential pitfall for these products is their pricing.
