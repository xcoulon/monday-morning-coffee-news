The author discusses architectural debt, distinguishing it from code debt. While code debt involves temporary hacks, architectural debt stems from structural decisions with long-term consequences. As an enterprise architect, the author focuses on how applications interact, data flow, and system maintenance rather than internal software workings.

Architectural debt extends beyond technical layers to business and strategy. At the application/infrastructure level, it involves issues like integration patterns, system overlap, and vendor lock-in, leading to increased costs and delivery times. At the business process level, it concerns ownership, outdated processes, and inaccurate documentation, impacting operations and increasing risk. At the strategy level, misdefined capabilities or outdated frameworks can lead to flawed long-term strategies.

Enterprise architects can identify and address this debt by gathering data, creating business cases, and presenting findings to leadership. They must prioritize efforts and be prepared to implement solutions.
