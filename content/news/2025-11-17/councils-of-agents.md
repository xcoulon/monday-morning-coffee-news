The article discusses using LLM agents, specifically within Claude Code, to enhance leadership skills and decision-making. It builds on previous posts about using AI as a coach and thinking partner. The core idea is to create "councils" of AI agents, each with a defined role (e.g., Principal Engineer, CEO), to simulate diverse perspectives. This allows users to asynchronously "brainstorm" ideas and receive nuanced feedback, accelerating strategic thinking before engaging with human teams. Examples include technical and executive councils, demonstrating how to define agents and query them for collective insights.
