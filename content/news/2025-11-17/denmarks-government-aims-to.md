Denmark's government announced a new political agreement to ban social media access for children under 15, with exceptions for 13-year-olds after specific assessment. Caroline Stage, Danish Minister for Digitalization, stated that 94% of Danish children under 13 use social media, exposing them to harmful content. The ban aims to protect children from violence and self-harm. While enforcement details are being finalized, Denmark plans to use its national electronic ID system and an age-verification app. Tech giants could face fines up to 6% of their global income for non-compliance. This move follows Australia's ban for under-16s and aligns with growing global concerns about children's online safety.
