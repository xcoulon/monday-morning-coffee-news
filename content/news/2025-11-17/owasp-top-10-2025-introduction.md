The 8th OWASP Top Ten for 2025 introduces two new categories and one consolidation, focusing on root causes of vulnerabilities. It's based on data from over 2.8 million applications and community survey input, balancing historical data with current practitioner insights. The update includes 589 Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) across 10 categories, with an average of 25 CWEs per category. Exploitability and impact scores are derived from CVE data, using a weighted average of CVSSv2 and CVSSv3 scores. The Top Ten aims to provide a comprehensive view of application security risks, acknowledging the limitations of purely data-driven approaches.
