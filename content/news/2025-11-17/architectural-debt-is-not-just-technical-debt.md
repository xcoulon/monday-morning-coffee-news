The author discusses architectural debt, distinguishing it from code debt. While code debt involves temporary hacks, architectural debt stems from structural decisions with long-term consequences. As an enterprise architect, the author focuses on how applications interact, data flow, and system maintenance rather than internal software workings.

Architectural debt extends beyond technical layers to business and strategy. At the application/infrastructure level, it involves issues like integration patterns and vendor lock-in. At the business process level, it concerns ownership, outdated processes, and documentation. At the strategy level, it relates to misdefined capabilities and flawed frameworks, leading to significant long-term impact. Enterprise architects can identify and address this debt by gathering data and presenting clear cases for improvement.
